Some interesting ideas were thrown around. These ideas ranged from specialised, local problems around Brisbane, to larger problems that impact the entire country or the world. Some of these problems include:</p><ul id="2a2fc1d7-f3cf-429b-a0da-bc9bcea67d88" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc"><code>TransLink Bus Tracker</code> The TransLink app only provides basic information about bus arrival times, and these aren’t typically accurate. Google Maps ironically seems to be more accurate, crowdsourcing the locations of busses (albeit probably not in the most ethical way as most people aren’t aware that this is happening) from their users’ phones. We could create a small hardware device with a small GPS receiver, 4G modem and battery pack that broadcasts bus locations to a central server every 20 to 30 seconds, providing a real-time indication of where busses are. This would make forecasting the position of busses significantly more accurate.</li></ul><ul id="c8ed67ff-1e7f-4ae5-8a73-255b8cbaf8d4" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc"><code>Digital Real-Estate Agent</code> Create a software system that guides house sellers through the process of filling out the required paperwork for selling their home, as well as a digital marketplace for featuring and selling homes (similar to that of Facebook Marketplace, but specifically targeted for selling homes and integrated with this service).</li></ul><ul id="ffc22683-7c28-4ad3-b5ab-609b4441eae1" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc"><code>Friend Finder</code> Create a platform that helps people find people with similar interests in the same area - this is particularly important now, especially considering the social impacts of the Coronavirus pandemic. (In retrospect, this could even be extended into an app that people can request for / volunteer to help each other e.g. with flood clean up).</li></ul><h1 id="1357bbc9-68b2-444f-8ee6-0b578d4e494c" class="">Week 2</h1><blockquote id="f5cb4cf6-f7c4-4c7b-88f4-af53f3d744d6" class="">Introduction to Bad Ideas &amp; Silly Ideas, as well as the process of iterating ideas.</blockquote><p id="42a4ac95-4bf5-49f6-b06b-83045f1d9fc5" class="">In the second week of the course, we are introduced to the concept of <em>Bad Ideas &amp; Silly Ideas - </em>an interesting framework developed by Prof Alan Dix. It is interesting to me that by explicitly labelling these ideas as <strong>bad ideas, </strong>it removes some of the stigma and fear around proposing an idea, and it getting shot down immediately. Here are some of the ideas that my table generated in the studio today:</p><table id="1213292a-caa3-42ec-9211-e6f6fa5d50c8" class="simple-table"><thead><tr id="7e2e0343-712b-42d1-855b-1b0c4942c324"><th id="ZLo@" class="simple-table-header">Initial &quot;Bad Idea&quot;

</td><td id="\nJX">Has the potential to create some really tasty drinks
</td><td id="}X@f">Pretty bad solution for a vessel that&#x27;s intended to hold a hot drink
 - the hot drink will conduct into your hand, but before that can even
happen, the chocolate would probably melt.
</td><td id="TMfQ">Create a double-walled mug with chocolate inserts that fit into the
mug. This way, your hands don&#x27;t burn, your beverage stays hot and you
can still enjoy the chocolatey goodness (and maybe even choose what type
 of chocolate you&#x27;d like based on the beverage)
</td></tr><tr id="fc215520-d386-44fd-b8c0-13311b5454bb"><td id="ZLo@">Glasses for blind people
</td><td id="\nJX">Could potentially be used to enhance the very low vision of these blind people?
</td><td id="}X@f">Not really terribly useful in the conventional sense.
</td><td id="TMfQ">Use the form factor of glasses to embed cameras all around the
user. When the system detects obstacles around the user, the band around
 the user&#x27;s head can vibrate, using various vibration patterns to
signify different hazards

</td><td id="\nJX">Increase both the typing speed and accuracy of the mobile computing
</td><td id="}X@f">Cumbersome and not very portable, annoying to carry around these extra items with you
</td><td id="TMfQ">Install a projector onto the device, in which a flat surface can be
used as an input device to both increase the input speed and accuracy of
 mobile computing.
</td></tr><tr id="52abad73-3d20-444c-8b46-31637fa6a913"><td id="ZLo@">Cars that don&#x27;t have any windows
</td><td id="\nJX">More robust structure can be created without the requirement of
having an opening for glass - potential applications in mines, or for
VIP protection?
</td><td id="}X@f">Claustrophobia concerns in the vehicle, not particularly pleasant to ride in a vehicle in which you can&#x27;t see out of.
</td><td id="TMfQ">Remove the windows in the car, but install displays in its place.
Assuming the car can drive itself around, the user could toggle between a
 live view (using external cameras) or other media / interact with a
computing device using the display.
